# Always-Here Chat App

This is an iOS app that allows you to chat with an AI character who is similar to a close friend or family member who has passed away. With this app, you can input the name of the AI character, their gender, and some personal traits to build their personality. From that point on, you can have a conversation with the AI character, who has a new preferred name.
